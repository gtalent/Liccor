# Getting liccor:
## Prerequisite:
* Install Go: http://golang.org/doc/install

## Installation:
* Run the following command:

		go get github.com/gtalent/liccor

# Usage(works for Go, C/C++, Javascript, and Java):

  Place a ".liccor" file in the root directory of the project, containing your license notice. The license notice in the file should not be commented out, liccor takes care of that.

  Run liccor to apply the copyright notice from .liccor to all the source files of the current directory and all sub-directories.
